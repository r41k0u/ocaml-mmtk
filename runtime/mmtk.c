   D1 mutator-side GC time (MMTK_MUTATOR_GC_TIME=1).

   The D1 CPU-budget comparison needs GC work attributed the same way on both
   runtimes. Vanilla runs ALL of its GC on the mutator, and its runtime_events
   spans capture it there. Under MMTk, per-thread attribution captures only the
   worker pool: the GC work the MUTATOR does — write barriers, TLAB refills,
   LOS allocations — lands in the mutator bucket and flatters MMTk. Measured on
   church (binarytrees-20): the identical program's "mutator" CPU is 2.5 s under
   MMTk vs 1.65 s under vanilla — that ~0.9 s IS this uncounted GC work.

   So: time the mutator-side GC entry points, report at exit, and let the
   harness add this to worker CPU (G) and subtract it from mutator CPU (W).
   All such work funnels through the helpers in this file — native code makes
   no other GC-related C calls — so wrapping them here is complete.

   Mechanics. TSC pairs (~20 ns/pair), accumulated in PER-DOMAIN plain u64
   slots (each domain writes only its own; no atomics on the hot path), summed
   at exit and converted via a monotonic-clock calibration of the TSC rate.
   Off = one predictable branch per call; armed only by MMTK_MUTATOR_GC_TIME.

   The park subtraction is load-bearing: a TLAB refill or LOS allocation can
   BLOCK FOR AN ENTIRE GC (its block acquisition polls, which can trigger a
   collection and park the mutator). TSC measures wall cycles, and a parked
   thread burns wall time but no CPU — without the subtraction a single
   blocking refill would book a whole multi-ms pause as mutator GC *CPU*. The
   alloc wrappers therefore subtract whatever caml_mmtk_park accumulated inside
   their window. Blocked time is D3's business (the pause log), not D1's.

     double-write (~20% of cycles on alloc-heavy code). This is safe for both

     - ConcurrentImmix: it is ALLOCATE-BLACK -- newly-allocated objects are born
       marked, and the concurrent marker does NOT field-scan freshly-allocated
     (black) objects, so the header-written / fields-unwritten window is never
             traced. Hence no-zero is safe here too.
     - Bactrian: both arguments compose. Young objects are never traced by the

       sliding-compaction plan whose mark / compute-forwarding passes
       reconstruct per-object metadata (the per-object VO bit + reserved
       forwarding header word) by reading object fields across the whole heap;
       the unzeroed-minor-heap discipline above does not cover those reads, so

/* Ragged safepoint (excise Phase 2, step 1): block the caller until every OCaml
   domain that was RUNNING OCaml at call time has passed one safepoint OR left
   the RUNNING set (parked / blocked / terminated). No global STW barrier, no
   GC. The two future callers (frametables RCU retire; runtime_events ring
   teardown) publish new state, then call this to drain all in-flight lock-free
   readers of the OLD state before freeing it. LIVE: the runtime_events ring
   teardown (runtime_events.c) is the current caller.

   Protocol:
   1. epoch = ++caml_mmtk_quiesce_epoch (release). Domains store this into their
      own mmtk_seen_quiesce_epoch at each safepoint (caml_mmtk_quiesce_ack).
   2. The caller is itself RUNNING and holds its domain lock; if it spun here it
      could deadlock a concurrent GC (which waits for running.is_empty()). So it
      leaves RUNNING for the wait -- caml_mmtk_enter_blocking(self) -- and
      re-enters cooperatively afterwards (caml_mmtk_become_running(self)), the
      exact handoff a C blocking section uses. As the WRITER it reads nothing of
      the old state between publish and free, so dropping RUNNING is
      reader-safe.
   3. Snapshot the RUNNING set NOW (mmtk_ocaml_snapshot_running). Domains in it
      are the in-flight readers we must wait for. (A domain that re-enters
      RUNNING after the bump via try_mark_running was STOPPED during our
      publish, so it cannot hold a pre-bump pointer -- and it is NOT in our
      snapshot, so it never makes us hang.)
   4. Poison every snapshot domain (caml_mmtk_interrupt) so a running one traps
      to its next safepoint and acks. A domain self-clears its OWN young_limit
      at that safepoint (caml_reset_young_limit), so we never call
      caml_mmtk_uninterrupt -- which would clobber a CONCURRENT GC's poison.
   5. Wait until, for every snapshot domain, EITHER mmtk_seen_quiesce_epoch >=
      epoch (it acked) OR it is no longer RUNNING (mmtk_ocaml_is_running == 0:
      parked / blocked / terminated holds no transient reader pointer). Poll on
      a short sleep, re-poisoning stragglers each round (a domain may have
      cleared its poison at an unrelated safepoint before acking our epoch).

   Latency caveat: a domain spinning in a tight allocation-free, poll-free loop
   never reaches a safepoint; the young_limit poison only bites at the next
   allocation or explicit poll. OCaml's bytecode loop polls and native
   back-edges insert poll points, so ordinary code reaches a safepoint promptly,
   but a hand-rolled C busy-loop with no caml_process_pending_actions is a
   (pre-existing, same as GC STW) bounded-latency exception.

   Re-entrancy: the epoch is a single global monotone counter, so two concurrent
   quiescers are individually correct (each waits for acks >= its OWN bump, and
   a later bump only makes earlier waiters' predicate easier). The future
   callers still serialise themselves with their own retire/teardown lock; this
   primitive does not require it for safety. */
