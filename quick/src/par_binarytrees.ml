(* Parallel port of sandmark multicore-numerical/binarytrees5_multicore.ml to
 * raw Domain.spawn (no Domainslib).
 *
 * The upstream multicore version splits, within each depth class, the [niter]
 * tree builds across domains (Domainslib async/await over i*niter/num_domains
 * .. (i+1)*niter/num_domains-1) and sums the per-domain checks. We do the same
 * with the stdlib-only parallel_for helper, accumulating each domain's partial
 * sum into a per-class total. Because every tree of depth d has the same check
 * value, the per-class total is the SAME however the niter builds are split
 * across domains, so the folded checksum is domain-count-INDEPENDENT — a
 * parallel-correctness self-check.
