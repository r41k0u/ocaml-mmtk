//! VMCollection for OCaml 5.x — multi-domain stop-the-world coordination.
//!
//! When MMTk collects, every OCaml domain (mutator) that is *running OCaml* must
//! be at a safe point before marking. The crux is "running OCaml": a domain is a
//! must-stop participant only while it holds its domain lock and is executing
//! mutator code. A domain that is parked at a safepoint, inside a C blocking
//! section, still booting (bound but not yet started), or terminating (left the
//! runtime's STW set) is, by construction, NOT running OCaml — it has no live,
//! mutating roots the GC could trip over — and must NOT be awaited.
//!
//! We track this with a per-mutator RUNNING state held in a set of the
//! `caml_domain_state` addresses currently running OCaml (`RUNNING`), tied to the
//! same lifecycle the runtime already drives:
//!
//!   - bind (register_mutator): a domain is born STOPPED (absent from the set).
//!     A child bound mid-spawn but not yet executing OCaml is therefore not awaited.
//!   - STOPPED edges (enter blocking section, park, deregister) remove the domain
//!     from the set immediately.
//!   - RUNNING edges (leave blocking section, resume from park, child boot) go
//!     through `caml_mmtk_become_running` (runtime/mmtk.c), which calls
//!     `mmtk_ocaml_try_mark_running` — that REFUSES while a collection is active
//!     and the caller then parks COOPERATIVELY (releasing the domain lock so its
//!     backup thread answers OCaml's own STW) before retrying. A domain therefore
//!     never spins on GC-active while holding its domain lock (which deadlocked
//!     OCaml's minor-heap STW), and never joins the awaited set of a collection
//!     that already passed its barrier (the check+insert are one critical section).
//!   - destroy/deregister (terminate): removed from the set (and the registry).
//!
//! Set semantics make every transition idempotent (re-mark RUNNING / re-mark
//! STOPPED / remove-absent are all no-ops), so the accounting cannot underflow
//! (the old `stopped: usize` counter could — see bug #3) and a transitioning
//! domain is simply absent rather than wedging the barrier (bug #3b).
//!
//! `stop_all_mutators` (GC worker) sets GC active, poisons every domain's
//! young_limit so running domains trap to a safepoint and park, then waits until
//! the RUNNING set is empty, and visits each registered mutator. `resume_mutators`
//! un-poisons and wakes everyone.
